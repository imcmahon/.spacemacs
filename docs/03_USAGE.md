## Usage

### Beginners

If you are unfamiliar with Emacs, I would start by reading the [BEGINNERS TUTORIAL](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.org) provided by the Spacemacs project. 

### Vim Users

There is a guide created for those [transitioning from vim to spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/VIMUSERS.org).


## Common Conventions

Spacemacs does a great job bringing different development languages together to use the same set of commands. For example for any language that has a registered test suite, typing `SPC m t` is the prefix for all test-related commands (`SPC m t X` will run the suite). See more [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/CONVENTIONS.org)

## What is in spacemacs? How do I do something?

If `SPC ?` (shows all commands available to the current mode) does not reveal the answer, the first place I'd check is the massive [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org) file.

### Something acting funny?

You'd be surprised, but more often than not the answer to your question is in the [FAQ](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/FAQ.org).
