# Customization

## Theme

There are a set of pre-configured themes in the base init.el configuration. To cycle through them, use `SPC T n`.

### Additional Themes

There are a bunch of additional themes found at the [Spacemacs Theme Gallery](http://themegallery.robdor.com).


If you want to try these out, you will need to add `themes-megapack` to the existing `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` section of `init.el` and restart Spacemacs (`SPC q r` or close and re-open Emacs manually).

Now that it's installed, you can use `SPC T s` to try all of them.
